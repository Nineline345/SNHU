**Directions**<br />
For this course, submit the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from your final project. This deliverable pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices that you have applied throughout this course.

Once you have submitted this artifact, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. These prompts are some of the “essential questions” for the Computer Science program. You will encounter these questions in different courses throughout the program. They are open-ended and meant to help you engage with “big ideas” in the field. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

**Questions**<br />
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?<br /><br />
        _Interpreting user needs and translating them into a functioning program begins with clear communication and empathy. I start by listening to the needs and wants of customer and stakeholders. Then we convert those statements into actionable changes and categorized them by priority (This can be done with story points or, honestly, any metric which articulates itself well enough for your entire team to understand it). However, By prioritizing user stories in the product backlog, teams can continuously refine and implement features that deliver real value to the end user._<br /><br />
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?<br /><br />
        _When I develop programs, I take an iterative and user-focused approach. I break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and prioritize continuous feedback and improvement. In my future work, I plan to incorporate Agile practices like sprint planning into my efforts. I believe sprint planning will noticeably improve the speed and efficacy with which I'm able to create personal projects_<br /><br />
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?<br /><br />
        _First and foremost, I believe being a good team member, in **ANY** career starts with having well developed soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, and critical thinking. You also want to ensure you're rigorously following coding practices set forth by your company/team and industry standards. Last but not least, a good team member is someone who makes ethical or legal concerns immediately visible to everyone involved. As technology continues to envelop everyone's lives, ethical concerns will sprout up more and more. Its vital that we always consider the consequences that fall on the common man when we falter in our ethics and morality._<br /><br />
